### About

Hi everyone, my name is Yuhan, and I'm currently a second-year [ScM in Biostatistics](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/academics/scm-dept-of-biostatistics) student at [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/). My research interests focus on leveraging real-world evidence (RWE) - such as electronic health records and claims data - to address biomedical challenges.

I graduated with a B.S. in [Honors Mathematics](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates/major-and-minor-programs/honors-mathematics.html) from the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), where I first developed my quantitative skills. After completing my degree, I worked as a statistical programmer specializing in health policy at [Acumen, LLC](https://www.acumenllc.com/). It was during this time that I discovered my passion for data analysis and public health. Most recently, I further honed my skills as a summer HEOR analyst intern at [Analysis Group](https://www.analysisgroup.com/), where I conducted statistical analyses using extensive claims and survey data. This experience deepened my understanding of the intersection between data and healthcare, solidifying my commitment to leveraging data-driven insights to improve public health outcomes.

Outside of school, I enjoy walking in nature, listening to music, and learning Spanish.
