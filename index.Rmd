## About

Hi everyone, my name is Yuhan. I'm a new ScM in Biostatistics student at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHSPH). My research interests include causal inference, precision medicine, and clinical trials.

Originally from China, I moved to Michigan four years ago to study mathematics at the University of Michigan. After completing my bachelor's degree, I worked as a statistical programmer specializing in health policy. It was during this time that I discovered my passion for data analysis and public health.

Outside of school, I enjoy watching movies️, listening to music, and writing in my journals. One of my favorite TV shows is Friends.
