### About

Hi everyone, my name is Yuhan. I'm a new [ScM in Biostatistics](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/academics/scm-dept-of-biostatistics) student at [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/). My research interests include causal inference, precision medicine, and clinical trials.

Originally from China, I moved to Michigan four years ago to study [Honors Mathematics](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates/major-and-minor-programs/honors-mathematics.html) at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/). After completing my bachelor's degree, I worked as a statistical programmer specializing in health policy at [Acumen, LLC](https://www.acumenllc.com/). It was during this time that I discovered my passion for data analysis and public health.

Outside of school, I enjoy watching movies üìΩÔ∏è, listening to musicüéµ, and writing in my journals ‚úç. One of my favorite TV shows is *Friends*.
