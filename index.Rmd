## Bio

Originally from China, I moved to Michigan four years ago to study mathematics at the University of Michigan. After completing my bachelor's degree, I worked as a statistical programmer specializing in health policy. It was during this time that I discovered my passion for data analysis and public health.

I am excited to share that I have been accepted into the ScM in Biostatistics program at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHSPH) and will begin my studies in fall 2023. I plan to delve into statistical theory, probability, and their applications in the biomedical sciences.

Outside of academia, I enjoy watching movies, listening to music, and writing in my journals. One of my favorite TV shows is Friends.
